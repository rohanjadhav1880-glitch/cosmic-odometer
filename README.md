# Cosmic Odometer

Cosmic Odometer is a playful, interactive calculator that shows how far you’ve traveled through the universe since birth.  
It combines Earth’s rotation, orbit, solar system drift, and galactic motion into a personalized “cosmic mileage” reading.

## Features
- Enter your birth date to calculate your personal cosmic distance.
- Distances shown for Earth’s rotation, orbit around the Sun, solar system drift, and galactic motion.
- Fun comparisons: Moon round trips, Pluto distance, progress toward a light year.
- Lightweight, browser‑based—no data sent to servers.
